			Using the Logger functions

	To simplify logging, there is a set of routines to perform all
needed logging operations. They are:

void loggerInit(char *host);
void loggerError(char *message);
void loggerEvent(char *message);

	loggerInit prepares needed data structures for logging.

	loggerError & loggerEvent write to the respective log file.

	To use these functions use the include file logger.h, found in
/ELDORA/rpc/include and add the file /ELDORA/rpc/bin/vxlogger.o to your link
step.

	NOTE: These routines do not do any formatting for you. The
format is still under development.
