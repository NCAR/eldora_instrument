ETH29 firmware test application
-------------------------------

This test application running under vxWorks initializes the ETH29
and then opens an UDP socket on port 50000 on which data is received.

The test application has been tested using a Motorola MV2306 VME carrier
and an ETH29 with VME base Address 0x50c00000 (rotary switches set to 0x50c).
The IP address assigned to the ETH29 is defined by ETH29_IP_ADDR in
the file eth29.c

To run the application using vxWorks, load the compiled object
	"ld < eth29_obj.o"
and call the main function
	"eth29"

Data can be sent to the board using socksend. For example:
	"socksend -d <ip address> -L 10 -p 50000 -u"
