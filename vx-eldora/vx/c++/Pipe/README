These are classes for pipes. The Pipe class is able to handle messages
of any size, while the class FixedPipe only handles fixed message sizes.

They are faster then the WRS version - at least on my MVME-133A.

The Ring class is required to build these. 

They require c++builtin.shar if you use g++.
