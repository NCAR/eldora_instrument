Strategy:

start a eldora-vx repository in /code/cvs, and start adding files directly
as they are needed, so that RCS ,v files can be moved directly into the
repository in the right place, preserving history

call it vx-eldora until it settles down, to avoid lots of emails

don't try to reconcile similar code between /net/eldora/eldora tree and
what's already in CVS.  Get it committed and building first, in as close a
form as the original, then reconcile.

----------------------------------------------------------------

organize and commit the code under /net/eldora/eldora.  The headers 
are already committed somewhere right?  Need to use the new eldora-only
source tree and commit the vxworks code under it, in the same style
as for sabl

kernel objects for housekeeper, rp7a, and rp7f need to be committed to CVS,
currently the operational copies reside on the 4u linux control pc

see eldora/Directory

	header-maker needs to go into cvs, Eric has master copy somewhere

	likewise for dsp code

4u hambo redhat 6.2 in lab has most recent changes

keep unix/hpa

not sure if eldora/display and eldora/tape are needed

makefile in newclk works, but not integrated in top-level makefile

clock/newclk/incl needs to be reconciled with vx/hskp/include

clk probably supercedes clock/newclk

housekeeper.o is the final product

the hskp and mhen directories build separate vxworks tadpole (68000?)
binaries for separate CPUs.  the other directories are for libraries shared
between the hskp and mhen

eldora/doc needs to be checked, probably not needed

keep eldora diag

already removed /net/eldora/sabl

ignore eldora/dsp

ignore arinc_NCAR

reconcile vx/minirims and hskp/src/minirims (probably the most recent)

ignore vx/h2

commit tape, but unused

ignore ddpath

ignore mhen/src/mhen_old, mhen/src/mhen

mhen/src needs top-level makefile

'make nu_arch' in mhen/src/nu_archit

how to find unused header files and remove them from the include directory

find unused source code

ignore eldora/hdr_maker

eldora/lib/vx may be object files that need to be preserved

vx/c and vx/c++ contain object files that need to be preserved

reconcile rpc/include/Header.h,hh


================================================================
Log of changes made to the copy of /net/eldora/eldora:

removed doc/logs and doc/specs

move *.skel into doc/skel

remove $Log$ from the skeleton files

mv Directory into doc

rm -rf bin

removed all *~ and *.o files, intending to copy back any .o that turn
out to be needed

remove diag/agc and diag/bin since empty

rm all but *.c files from diag/datatape

import RCS files from diag/mcpl/RCS

remove diag/mcpl/mcpl_menu.rn

rm -rf diag/mcpltst

rm -rf diag/tape (empty)

rm diag/vmevme/includes

import RCS files from diag/vmevme

import RCS files under display

rm display/util/uitc/{a,q}


rpc/include/Aircraft.h actually looks like it got overwritten with
Parameter.h, but the copy in rpc/header still has a Aircraft structure in
it, so I'm assuming that's correct
