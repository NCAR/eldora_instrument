Move all files from this directory into the appropriate sibling directories
to keep them with their associated implementations.  RPC header files should 
be built from .x files and builds should install the headers from their new home 
directories back here.  See ../header (Header.h, HeaderRpc.x, SConscript) for 
an example where the files have already been moved.
