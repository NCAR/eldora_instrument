GPS Integration - Kalman Filter (rate?); other approaches? References?
GPS use in initial alignment?
Bortz Calculations?
Gravity Modelling?
Gyro Compassing - can this be done w/x-axis approx. horizontal?
Use of Kalman Filter in initial alignment, rate?
Why periodic matrix orthogonalization (ortho.c) ?
Can we throw away CRC Task? Is it only used for telemetry?
Mode Definitions - specifically alignment modes.
Spin Stabilization? => spin task, ac_soft, ac_hard, etc. -
                       can we eliminate them?
What kind of hardware does this run on? How much reserve performance?
