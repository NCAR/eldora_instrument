This is a class for local events flags. It requires c++builtin.shar if
you use g++. The makefile uses my local modification to
/usr/include/make/default.mk for g++ rules. This can be had from the
archive in g++.rules.patch. DO NOT run the make install target, it is
for my local use, unless you modify its behavior.
