These are some simple C routines that supply GNU g++ running under
VxWorks with routines to do new and delete as well as the
set_new_handler, so you can do your own new. Also included are global
constructor/destructor routines & a dummy CTOR/DTOR list. To use make
builtin++.o and then if you have global objects, run collect over your
object code and then link builtin++.o with the original object code
and the object you make from the collect file. If you do not have any
global objects, link builtin++.o with ctor_dummy.o.
