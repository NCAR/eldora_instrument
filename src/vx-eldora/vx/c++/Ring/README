This is a class for ring buffers. It is faster then the WRS version - at least
on my MVME-133A.

They require c++builtin.shar if you use g++. 

ringtst.cc is a simple comparative timing test of WRS' rngBuffers vs. Ring.
The script file testcase will run some differently sized elements 
through the test.
